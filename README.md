# Smallchat

## A minimal programming example for a chat server

This is a fork from https://github.com/antirez/smallchat

Mainly using it to help me better understating socket programming and adding new features for fun.

## New Features Im planning to add

### Basic ones

1. Timestamps: Add timestamps to messages [completed 30-Oct-2023 ]
2. Online Users List: Show a list of currently connected users.
3. Message Formatting: Allow users to format their text, like asterisks for bold text?
4. Direct Message: Allow users to send private message
5. Message History: Store the last N messages and show them to users when they join
6. User Authentication: add a simple username and password authentication step
7. File Sharing
8. Encryption: between the server and clients
9. Multi-threaded
