# Smallchat

## A minimal programming example for a chat server

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/antirez/smallchat

Mainly using it to help me better understating socket programming and adding new features for fun.

## Upcoming Features I Intend to Implement

2. Online Users List: Show a list of currently connected users.                         [Completed 01-Dec-2023]
